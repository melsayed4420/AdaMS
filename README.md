# AdaMS
AdaMS is an assembly-like programming language built to be free of any C built-in functions so it can be embedded into any OS (Actually, I'm developing it for my OS)

AdaMS doesn't mean Adam's. No. The name has another meaning. Actually, M is the first character of my name, and S is the first character of my Ex's. That's why they are capitalized. And Adam is the name that we decided it to be our first son's name.
PS : we broke up long time ago. But I'm not willing to change the project's name, neither my first son's name.

That's about the name, the documentation of the project will be posted right after getting it to work stably.
